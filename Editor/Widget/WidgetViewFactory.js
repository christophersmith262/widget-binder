   * In certain cases, we desire to create a view simply to use its markup

   * state.

   * themselves from being destroyed, and can cause unwanted side-effects by
   * attaching their own notification handlers to the model. To prevent this, 
   * we use this method to create a short-term lifecycle view that can be
   * discarded without side-effects.
