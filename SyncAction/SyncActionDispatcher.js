/**
 * A central dispatcher for sending commands to the canonical data store.
 *
 * Default Supported Actions:
 *
 *   INSERT_ITEM: Requests a new edit buffer item from the data store. This
 *   triggers the creation of an edit buffer item on the server, and should
 *   resolve with the new item.
 *
 *   EDIT_ITEM: Requests that an existing edit buffer item be edited. This
 *   triggers an edit flow on the server. The actual details of that flow are
 *   not enforced. For example, the server may deliver back an ajax form for the
 *   edit buffer item and resolve the action once that form is submitted. The
 *   resolution should include the updates made to the edit buffer item model.
 *
 *   RENDER_ITEM: Requests the representational markup for a data entity that
 *   will be rendered in the editor viewmode. The command should resolve with
 *   the edit buffer item model containing the updated markup. This markup will
 *   automatically be synced to the widget. The markup can also contain inline
 *   editable fields in the format specified by the sync configuration.
 *
 *   DUPLICATE_ITEM: Requests that an item be duplicated in the store, resulting
 *   in a newly created item. This command should resolve with the newly created
 *   edit buffer model.
 *
 *   FETCH_SCHEMA: Requests the schema for a field from the server. This should
 *   resolve with a schema model detailing which other types of fields can be
 *   nested inside the given field type.
 *
 * @param {SyncProtocol} protocol
 *   A protocol plugin for handling the request / response transaction.
 * @param {SyncActionResolver} resolver
 *   The resolver service for processing sync action responses.
